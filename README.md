# CopyCode

Copy contents of files to ask something to a LLM.

## Features

- Copy Open Files: copy the content of all files that are currently open in the editor.
- Copy Current File: copy the entire content of the currently active file in the editor.
- Copy All Files: copy the content of all files in the current workspace or directory

Each file's path is included at the top, and the code is simplified (no line breaks or spaces) to use fewer tokens in LLMs.

## Usage

1. Install the extension.
2. Simply click one of the copy buttons at the bottom right.
3. Paste in LLM or somewhere else
